BrickBreak
==========

The first HTML5/JS game I'm making

==========

I made initial headway with this game with SimpleGame.JS, but I was running into brickwalls (literally!) with the power of the engine. I've decided to complete this project with Phaser 2, however a lot of my time is being taken up with a work project so I'll probably get back to this after or during the next Ludum Dare.

Fun times await!
